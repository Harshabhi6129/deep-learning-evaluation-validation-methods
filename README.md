# 📊 Deep Learning Model Evaluation & Validation

A comprehensive resource to understand, implement, and visualize **deep learning evaluation and validation techniques**, including code notebooks and a published guide.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository aims to bridge the gap between model performance metrics and their real-world interpretation. Often, we see high accuracy but overlook critical metrics such as **Precision, Recall, AUC**, and **Confusion Matrices** — especially when working with imbalanced or multi-class datasets.

This project includes:
- 📓 A Jupyter notebook implementing various evaluation techniques.
- 📄 A PDF guide explaining the theory and practical relevance behind each metric.
- 🧪 Examples covering classification and regression metrics.
- 📉 Visualization of learning curves and use of early stopping.
